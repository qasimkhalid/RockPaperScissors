     * Unit tests for Controller
     * --------------------------
     * 1. Routes should work! - test controller and urls - make custom http client and try to hit your rest api endpoints
     *    with proper and improper data
     * 2. Make tests to check request body in proper json format
     * 3- Make dummy json body to check if json is valid or not
     * 4- Will it create player move object or not after safe processing?
